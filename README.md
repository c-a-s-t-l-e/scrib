### Convenient Reading, Better Understanding

Essentially, the end goal of scrib is to provide the user a tool that allows them to read a pdf, leave bookmarks where they would like to, and leave the door open to try an approach to reading based off of Mortimor Adler's book (_How to Read a Book_)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book]

The three parts consisting of:

1. Identifying the pieces that make up the text (the structure).
2. Making a list of posssible central question that the author was trying to answer.
3. Providing evidence why the central question you eventually decided on is the one based off of the text.
